Summary: The start of my blog during lockdown, written in Python and Markdown, just to try it out. Seems easy enough.

### England went into lockdown on 23rd March 2020. The world has changed dramatically. What has surprised me is how compliant the general public were, are. Yes, everyone, or almost everyone is happy to accept 'The new normal' and our reduced freedoms. There have been few demonstrations that I am aware of, but then I don't watch the news any more. I am aware of the censorship by organisations such as YouTube, Google, Vimeo and Facebook.

### I've been most surprised though at how rapidly things are changing in the background. Our laws are changing, whilst [parliment sleeps](https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/5050/alarm-two-billion-people-have-parliaments-suspended-or-limited-covid-19/). Slowly [new laws](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-bill-summary-of-impacts/coronavirus-bill-summary-of-impacts) are creeping in and being passed, [society](https://news.un.org/en/story/2020/04/1062632) and government is changing. Men continue to be demonised and also the [women who support them](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-7732557/The-women-demonised-championing-mens-rights.html). The [new Domestic Abuse Bill](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/domestic-abuse-bill-2020-factsheets/domestic-abuse-bill-2020-overarching-factsheet), means that soon; men, by law, won't be classed as victims of domestic abuse even though [1/3](https://fullfact.org/crime/are-third-domestic-abuse-victims-men/) of victims are officially men. The response to this is that 2/3rd's are women as though the bigger number cancels out the smaller number.

### What is the world coming to?

### It's certainly not for us humans; the ordinary men and women of this world. 

### Makes you wonder, what really is going on?

### For me the solution is good nutrition. More on that, later.
